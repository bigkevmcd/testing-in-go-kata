* The basics

* Why test?

- Confidence
- Next person
- Onboarding
- Design

* Fizz Buzz kata

  Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of
  three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print
  "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print
  "FizzBuzz?".

* Writing Go tests

* Built-in testing framework.

Provided by the `testing` package and the `go test` command.

.code src/fizzbuzz1/fizzbuzz_test.go

* Running tests

The `go test` command runs tests for the specified package.

	$ go test
	PASS
	ok      fizzbuzz    0.009s

	$ go test -v
	=== RUN   TestFizzWithMultipleOf3
	--- PASS: TestFizzWithMultipleOf3 (0.00s)
	=== RUN   TestFizzWithNonMultipleOf3
	--- PASS: TestFizzWithNonMultipleOf3 (0.00s)
	PASS
	ok      fizzbuzz    0.009s

* Running tests

To run the tests for the entire tree of your project:

	$ go test ./...

To run tests matching a specific regexp:

	$ go test -v -run TestFizzWithMultiple

* My vim setup

`https://github.com/janko-m/vim-test`

*\t* - runs the test under the cursor `:TestNearest`
*\T* - runs the tests in the current file `:TestFile`
*\l* - runs the last test `:TestLast`
*\a* - runs the ./... tests `:TestSuite`

* vim-go

 GoImports

* Useful test failures

.link https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments#useful-test-failures

 Note that the order here is actual != expected, and the message uses that order too.

* Table-driven tests

Go's struct literal syntax makes it easy to write table-driven tests:

.code src/fizzbuzz2/fizzbuzz_test.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

* Table-driven tests

	=== RUN   TestFizzBuzzTable
	--- FAIL: TestFizzBuzzTable (0.00s)
	        fizzbuzz_test.go:24: incorrect message for 5: got , expected Buzz
	        fizzbuzz_test.go:24: incorrect message for 10: got , expected Buzz
	        fizzbuzz_test.go:24: incorrect message for 15: got Fizz, expected FizzBuzz?
	FAIL

.link https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/TableDrivenTests

* testing.T

The `*testing.T` argument is used for error reporting:

	t.Errorf("incorrect message for 3: got %s, expected Fizz", msg)
	t.Fatalf("incorrect message for 3: got %s, expected Fizz", msg)

`Fatalf` exits the test immediately.

	=== RUN   TestFizzBuzzTable
	--- FAIL: TestFizzBuzzTable (0.00s)
	        fizzbuzz2_test.go:24: incorrect message for 5: got , expected Buzz
	FAIL

* Subtests...

.code src/fizzbuzz3/fizzbuzz_test.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

	=== RUN   TestFizz
	=== RUN   TestFizz/With_multiple_of_3
	=== RUN   TestFizz/With_non-multiple_of_3
	--- PASS: TestFizz (0.00s)
	    --- PASS: TestFizz/With_multiple_of_3 (0.00s)
	    --- PASS: TestFizz/Withn_non-multiple_of_3 (0.00s)
	PASS

* Test coverage

The `go` tool can report test coverage statistics.

	$ go test -cover
	PASS
	coverage: 100.0% of statements
	ok      fizzbuzz    0.009s

The `go` tool can generate coverage profiles that may be intepreted by the `cover` tool.

	$ go test -coverprofile=fizzbuzz.out
	PASS
	coverage: 100.0% of statements
	ok      fizzbuzz    0.009s
	$ go tool cover -func=fizzbuzz.out
	fizzbuzz/fizzbuzz.go:3: FizzBuzz    100.0%
	total:          (statements)    100.0%

* Testable Code

- Just as important as writing tests, is writing code that can be tested easily
- "this can't be tested" - usually because it's written in a way that makes it hard to test
- Rewrite for testability!

* Print!

.code src/fizzbuzz4/fizzbuzz.go /PRINTER OMIT/,/ENDPRINTER OMIT/

TODO

* Closures

.code src/fizzbuzz5/fizzbuzz.go /PRINTER OMIT/,/ENDPRINTER OMIT/

* Fixtures!

* Integration setup

.code src/integration/redis_test.go /SETUP OMIT/,/ENDSETUP OMIT/

* Integration setup

.code src/integration/redis_test.go /TEST OMIT/,/ENDTEST OMIT/

* Setup and teardown

.code src/integration/redis2_test.go /TEST OMIT/,/ENDTEST OMIT/

* Setup and teardown fail

	=== RUN   TestRedis
	=== RUN   TestRedis/Set_initial_value
	=== RUN   TestRedis/Handle_no_initial_value
	--- FAIL: TestRedis (0.01s)
	    --- PASS: TestRedis/Set_initial_value (0.00s)
	    --- FAIL: TestRedis/Handle_no_initial_value (0.00s)
	        redis2_test.go:39: unexpected result: got 'value', expected nil
	FAIL
	exit status 1
	FAIL    glasgowtdd/integration  0.017s

* Implementing setup and teardown

* Dojo Kun

- We respect each others’ commitment
- = no phones, email, Facebook... Focus!
- We all do TDD
- We all do Pair Programming
- We swap partners each cycle
- We follow ‘Simple Design' rules

* Simple Design

Simple Design is code that:

1. Passes all the tests
2. Is clear, expressive and consistent
3. Duplicates no behaviour or configuration
4. Minimises the number of classes and methods and modules

* Mission to Mars Kata

- We are sending robot rovers to Mars
- We have a 2D map of Mars in a grid reference (think lat/lon)
- We will get sent a command sequence from Prestwick Space Centre

* Robots

- Each robot is initialised with single-digit coordinates and a facing N, S, E or W
- Rovers can be signalled with instructions:
 - ‘L’ = Turn Left
 - ‘R’ = Turn Right
 - ‘F’ = Move Forward

* Sample instructions

.code sample_commands.txt

* Expected output

- The expected output from your code will be for each robot: its position as X and Y coordinates and facing separated by single spaces e.g.

1 1 W

* Begin

* Mission Update

- *Alert!* Robots are being lost falling off the edge of the Mesa!
- To stop this, all robots are now fitted with scent markers to mark where a robot leaves the Mesa and in which direction
- A robot that is instructed to move off the Mesa where another robot has previously been lost will ignore the order
